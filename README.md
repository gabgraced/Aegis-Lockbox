# Aegis Lockbox

A decentralized knowledge preservation and controlled dissemination protocol built on the Clarity blockchain.

## Overview

Aegis Lockbox is a smart contract system designed to provide secure, verifiable storage for documents and sensitive information. It allows users to register documents with cryptographic fingerprints, delegate access based on roles, and manage access permissions with fine-grained control over document modifications.

## Features

- **Decentralized Document Storage:** Securely store documents with cryptographic fingerprints.
- **Access Control:** Fine-grained delegation of access rights with roles such as `read`, `write`, and `admin`.
- **Versioning:** Track and update documents with automatic modification timestamps.
- **Validation:** Comprehensive validation for inputs, document categories, and privileges.
- **Delegation:** Enable controlled access delegation to other principals with expiration and permission flags.

## Smart Contract Functions

- `register-document`: Registers a new document in the system.
- `update-document`: Allows for updating an existing document.
- `delegate-document-access`: Delegates document access rights to other users.
- `revise-existing-document`: Updates an existing document with new information.
- `expedited-document-registration`: A fast-track method for document registration.
- `protected-document-revision`: Secure document revision with enhanced checks.

## Prerequisites

- A Clarity-compatible blockchain environment (e.g., Stacks blockchain).
- A Clarity compiler for smart contract deployment.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Aegis-Lockbox.git
   cd Aegis-Lockbox
   ```

2. Compile and deploy the contract using the Clarity tools.

3. Interact with the contract using the provided functions for document management.

## Usage

The following examples show how you can interact with the Aegis Lockbox contract:

### Register a Document
```clarity
(let
  (
    (result (register-document "Document Title" "fingerprint" "Some narrative text" "Category" '("keyword1" "keyword2")))
  )
  (ok result)
)
```

### Delegate Document Access
```clarity
(let
  (
    (result (delegate-document-access 1 "principal-address" "write" 1000 true))
  )
  (ok result)
)
```
